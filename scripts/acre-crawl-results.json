It was designed to work best for scenarios where individual units will be rehabbed over the hold at varying times.…One way to become a better real estate financial modeling professional, is to watch other professionals model. I know in my career being able to physically see how others tackle different modeling problems has shaped my methods and made me better…You may recall that a couple of weeks ago, I began to explore Stochastic Modeling concepts, or the idea of adding probability into my models, to get a more complete picture of the risk-return metrics of an investment.

As evidenced by the numerous requests we have gotten for this over the years, this model is long overdue so I’m quite happy to get it out there finally. At the core, the hotel development model is basically a hybrid of our Hotel Acquisition Model – The Basic Model and our Condominium Development Model with a lot of customization work added. Between the both of those models, there was mostly everything we needed, so if you have used or are familiar with either of those models, the components and the mechanics of this model should be somewhat familiar to you. <img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-95305\" class=\"size-entry_without_sidebar wp-image-95305\" src=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/newly-development-hotel-1210x423.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1210\" height=\"423\"/>Analyze a ground-up hotel development What’s Included in the Hotel Development Model The model contains seven worksheets as follows: Summary – contains General Info, Timing, Exit Assumptions, Project Level and Partnership Returns, Sources and Uses, Property Metrics, Construction Financing and Refinancing Assumptions, Sensitivity Analysis, Visual of Capital Outflow During Development Operating Cash Flow – contains annual operating projections and input assumptions for revenue and expense line items. Also, allow for year 1 stabilization projections for occupancy on a monthly basis. Budget – build or input your budget assumptions here. Monthly Cash Flows – here is where you project out your development cash flows, review the draw schedule and input your interest rate projections, adjust the seasonality of your NOI, and review your monthly levered and unlevered cash flows. Annual Cash Flows – A simplified roll up of the monthly cash flows Custom Cash Flows – if you select Custom projections for any budget line item in the Monthly Cash Flow tab, you will come to this tab and manually input your custom cash flow. Waterfall – model out partnership splits between a GP and LP over four tiers using IRR hurdles. <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-23235 size-large\" src=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/accelerator-horizontal-1030x83.jpg\" alt=\"a discussion of the A.CRE Accelerator real estate financial modeling courses\" width=\"1030\" height=\"90\"/> Video Tutorial – Using the Hotel Development Model Video Tutorial #2 – New Mezz Debt Component Review Video Tutorial #3 – Updates for v1.3 – Sensitivity Analysis and Visual of Capital Outflow During Development among Other Updates Download the A.CRE Hotel Development Model To make this model accessible to everyone, it is offered on a “Pay What You’re Able” basis with no minimum (enter $0 if you’d like) or maximum (your support helps keep the content coming – similar real estate development models sell for $100 – $300+ per license).

        "content": "I’ve spent the past few weekends working on a purpose-built Self Storage Acquisition Model, and I’m now happy to share the result of that work with you. This is a model that’s been requested by quite a few A.CRE readers over the past few years. I released a Self Storage Development Model last year, and that release only intensified the demand for a Self Storage model for acquisitions. Below find a written explanation of how the model is built, a video walking you through how to use it, and a link to download the model. Enjoy! This model likely still contains errors. If you spot an error, have a feature request, or would like to make a suggestion to improve the model, please let me know. <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1107215 size-entry_with_sidebar\" src=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/riverside-storage-updated-845x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"845\" height=\"321\"/> How the Self Storage Acquisition Model Was Built This model was built using the core functionality of our Value-Add Apartment Acquisition model. In recent years, I’ve designed my models using a combination of independent modules all connected to one another. I also incorporate the Investment Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow, and Reversion Cash Flow DCF framework taught in our real estate financial modeling training Accelerator program. What this bolt-on technique allows me to do is to easily adapt existing models for other purposes. So in this case, I took my Value-Add Apartment Acquisition model, replaced the apartment Operating Cash Flow module with a self storage Operating Cash Flow module, and made a variety of miscellaneous changes to the other modules and voila. A robust, institutional-quality, purpose-built Self Storage Acquisition Model. And it only took about 20 hours to complete, rather than the hundreds of hours it would have taken had I built the model from scratch. The ‘Summary’ tab includes key facts, assumptions, returns, and two column charts to visualize the cash flows Using the Model – Self Storage Acquisition Model Given that the backbone of the Self Storage Acquisition model is the Value-Add Apartment Acquisition model, if you’ve used my Value-Add Apartment Acquisition model than you can use this model. The model only contains three worksheets, but don’t assume it’s lacking in functionality. This model contains everything you would expect from an institutional self storage acquisition model. If you’re familiar with my modeling work, a few years ago I moved to a design concept where all of the underwriting is on one worksheet – the ‘Underwriting’ worksheet. This greatly improves the user experience, makes modifying/improving the model much easier, improves model performance from a memory and CPU standpoint, and I think is more intuitive once you get used to it. When you first open the model, you find three visible worksheets: Version, Summary, and Underwriting. By default, a 4th worksheet called Annual Cash Flow is hidden. But you can make this worksheet visible by clicking the ‘Annual Report: Show’ button on the Summary tab. Below, I talk through what each worksheet contains. Version Tab (Visible by default) The model opens initially to the Version tab so you can see what changes have been made in the most recent version of the model. On this tab you can also find links to model tutorials, guides, support, and other information. Summary Tab (Visible by default) While the return metrics levered IRR, levered EMx, Cash-on-Cash Return, and other property and partnership-level returns are shown in various places on the Underwriting tab, the most important metrics are summarized / visualized on the Summary tab. The summary tab also includes two charts, a strengths/weaknesses section, a frame to include a picture/map, and a summary of the investment. The Summary tab is meant to be printed, and as such the view mode is set to Print Preview by default. Underwriting Tab (Visible by default) The Underwriting tab is where all of your primary inputs are entered. The tab is broken up into six sections, built from top to bottom. The sections can be accessed either by scrolling down to each or using the buttons along the top of the screen. The six sections are ‘Description’, ‘Investment Cash Flow’, ‘Operating Cash Flow’, ‘Reversion (Sale) Cash Flow’, ‘Returns (Property and Partnership)’, and ‘Sensitivity’. Annual Cash Flows (Hidden by default) The Annual Cash Flow tab rolls up the monthly cash flows to annual periods, so you can view high-level cash flows on one page. The report is printable. You can access the report by pressing the ‘Show’ toggle on the Summary tab within the Property Cash Flow section. <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-54203 size-full\" src=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/accelerator-horizontal.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/accelerator-horizontal.jpg 1920w, https://www.adventu",

        "content": "I’ve spent a fair amount of my career analyzing privately-owned student housing investments. Nevertheless, I’ve yet to share a purpose-built, institutional-quality student housing acquisition model. So, I thought I’d take some time and build a model for this very purpose. To do this, I took my Value-Add Apartment Acquisition model, which has been used by tens of thousands of people and has gone through dozens of revisions, and adapted it to create this student housing acquisition model. This pro forma in Excel seeks to capture the nuance of core, core-plus, and value-add student housing analysis. I hope you’re able to make good use of this model! Note: While this model is built on the core functionality of an Excel model that has been crowd-tested, it still undoubtedly contains errors. You’ll also likely find features missing that you’d like added. Version 1.2, in particular, contains a significant number of changes. Therefore, if you find a bug or have a feature you’d like added, shoot me a note and I’ll look to include your feedback in a future version of the model. <img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-599051\" class=\"wp-image-599051 size-entry_without_sidebar\" src=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/student-housing-model-operating-cash-flow-1210x423.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1210\" height=\"423\"/>The Operating Cash Flow section of the Student Housing Acquisition Model Basic Objectives – Student Housing Acquisition Model The general layout and design of the Student Housing Acquisition model (and many other newer real estate models shared here at A.CRE) follow the one-page underwriting format I first shared with my Apartment Development model. This should be a familiar format for many of you – especially those that are learning to build models from scratch in our real estate Accelerator program. And in particular, those who are proficient using my Value-Add Apartment Acquisition model will be able to jump in and immediately use this model. As with my other one-page underwriting models, nearly 100% of inputs are on one, easy to use tab (i.e. worksheet) – the Underwriting tab. Cash flows are shown immediately to the right of the inputs on the Underwriting tab, and the outcomes are reported on an attractive and printer-friendly Summary tab. All other tabs are either optional or for tracking version changes. <img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-599059\" class=\"wp-image-599059 size-entry_without_sidebar\" src=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/summary-tab-student-housing-model-1210x423.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1210\" height=\"423\"/>The Summary tab – Where the key outcomes of your analysis are visually shown in a printable form. Overview – Student Housing Acquisition Model The Student Housing Acquisition Model includes one primary inputs tab, one primary report tab, an optional annual cash flow tab, an optional detailed expenses tab, and a tab to track version changes to the model. Version Tab (Visible by default) The model opens initially to this tab so you can see what changes have been made in the most recent version of the model. On this tab you can also find links to model tutorials, guides, support, and other information. Underwriting Tab (Visible by default) The Underwriting tab is where all of your primary inputs are entered. The tab is broken up into six sections, built from top to bottom. The sections can be accessed either by scrolling down to each or using the buttons along the top of the screen. The six sections are ‘Investment Description’, ‘Investment Cash Flows’, ‘Operating Cash Flows’, ‘Reversion Cash Flows’, ‘Property-Level Returns’, and ‘Partnership-Level Returns (Waterfall)’. Summary Tab (Visible by default) While property-level return metrics levered IRR and levered EMx are shown along the top of the Underwriting tab, the bulk of the risk and return metrics are shown/visualized on the Summary tab. The summary tab also includes two operating cash flows charts, a strengths/weaknesses section, a frame to include a picture/map, and a summary of the investment. The Summary tab is meant to be printed, and as such the view mode is set to Print Preview by default. Annual Cash Flow Tab (Hidden by default) The annual cash flow tab rolls up the monthly cash flows to annual periods, so you can view high-level cash flows on one page. The report is printable. You can access the report by pressing the ‘Show’ toggle on the Summary tab with the Property Cash Flow section. Detail Expenses (Hidden by default) On the Underwriting tab the user has the option to toggle a detailed operating expenses mode. Rather than entering per unit values for pre-renovation (i.e in-place) and post-revonation (i.e. stabilized) operating expense line items, when the user toggles the ‘Detailed’ operating expense mode on the Underwriting tab, a ‘Detail Expense’ tab becomes available where the user can detail out operating expenses. The detail then flows back t",

        "content": "As the built environment evolves to meet the demands of an increasingly digital world, data centers have emerged as one of the most sophisticated and capital-intensive asset classes in commercial real estate. What was once considered a niche subset of infrastructure has become a foundational layer of the global economy, driven by AI, cloud computing, SaaS, 5G, blockchain, and machine learning. The shift is unmistakable. Institutional capital is rapidly moving into digital infrastructure assets. Hyperscale platforms, sovereign wealth funds, REITs, private equity, and infrastructure funds are deploying billions into the development of large-scale, mission-critical facilities. With that growth comes both a challenge and an opportunity for real estate professionals: to model, structure, and evaluate these investments with the same precision and discipline expected in any core asset class. <img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1132387\" class=\"wp-image-1132387 size-entry_without_sidebar\" src=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/An-external-view-of-a-hyperscale-modern-data-center-building-1210x423.jpg\" alt=\"Data Center Development Model\" width=\"1210\" height=\"423\"/>An external view of a hyperscale modern data center building That need led to creating the Data Center Development Model — a powerful tool designed for real estate professionals underwriting digital infrastructure from development through stabilization. Whether you’re underwriting a single-tenant build-to-suit or a multi-phase hyperscale campus, this model equips you to forecast capital deployment, model phased ramp-up schedules, structure layered capital stacks, calculate OpEx recoveries, and evaluate stabilized exits with confidence. More than just a financial model, this tool is a framework built for professionals working at the intersection of real estate, infrastructure, and technology. In what follows, I’ll explore the key drivers of value in data center development and walk through a modeling approach specifically designed for this asset class. Note: Special thanks to Spencer Burton for sparking this idea and encouraging its development from the start. Data Center Development Financial Modeling In traditional real estate, we’re taught to model value around square footage. Whether it’s office, multifamily, industrial, or retail, the core assumptions revolve around rentable space — how many square feet, at what rate, and over what absorption period. But that framework doesn’t hold in data center development. Here, the monetized product isn’t space — it’s power. Specifically: IT Load, measured in kilowatts (kW). It’s the core unit of design, the basis for tenant leases, and the foundation for how investors and lenders size capital. Power is what drives revenue. It dictates how infrastructure is built, what redundancy is required, and how the facility performs. In these deals, space is secondary. A data hall could be physically complete, but without an energized IT Load, it’s economically offline. That’s why the financial model has to evolve. That said, a data center model must: Follow how power is ramped over time, not just delivered upfront Reflect the way rent is billed — by the kilowatt, not by the square foot Capture pro rata expense recovery based on power, not area Allow for real vacancy and ramp lag, even on fully executed leases Tie capital cost and revenue to a common metric: $/kW delivered Whether you’re underwriting your first hyperscale lease or evaluating a three-phase GPU campus, your model needs to align with how capital flows into these deals. That means thinking in terms of delivered power, leased capacity, and stabilized NOI per kW. The Data Center Development Model was built to meet that standard, combining real estate fundamentals with the technical precision required for digital infrastructure. For example, it captures the development draw schedule, tenant ramp timing, OpEx recovery, general vacancy & credit loss, and exit valuation — all centered around IT Load. Because when it comes to data centers, modeling power isn’t just helpful — it’s essential. The Core Drivers of the Data Center Development Model The Data Center Development Model was built from the ground up to serve one purpose: to help real estate professionals underwrite institutional-scale digital infrastructure projects with the same rigor they bring to traditional asset classes. This is a developer-focused, fully dynamic tool designed to handle scenarios where the business plan includes developing, leasing, stabilizing, and ultimately disposing of hyperscale data center assets. The model follows the full investment lifecycle — draw schedule, construction phasing, tenant absorption, operating cash flow generation, and valuation at stabilization — all tied to the economic engine of IT Load. The Data Center Development Model template is purpose-built for real estate professionals, capital partners, and digital infrastructure",

This person typically is involved with the transaction from land sourcing through lease-up and is depended on by a host of stakeholders to insure the outcome of the project is a successful one. Not for the faint of heart – development can be stressful, risky, and laden with hurdles – the capable and experience-hardened developer commands arguably the highest compensation in the industry. It’s very much a high risk, high reward career.

        "content": "As many of you recall, in 2015 I set out to build an Excel alternative to the widely-used (and now discontinued) ARGUS DCF. With career moves and a lot of other A.CRE-related side projects, this undertaking has been slow going. Alas, in 2016 I released the first beta-version of the model – my All-in-One (Ai1) Underwriting Tool for Real Estate Development and Acquisition in Excel (catchy name, I know!). Since that release, I’ve continued to update the model regularly, correcting errors and adding features you, the user, are asking for. The model has been downloaded thousands of times and hundreds of you are actively contributing to continuous and substantive improvements. As I find time and as your suggestions come in, I’ll continue to update the model with the hope that one day, it might have its permanent place in commercial real estate underwriting. In November 2019, after over 40 updates over two years, we officially removed the beta label from the model. This means that it has received sufficient community feedback and testing that it is largely stable. With that said, the model likely still contains errors and room for improvement. So if you spot something needing changed, please let us know. Download the Model | Guide to Getting Started | Video Intro | Version Notes | Model Support Read about the limitations of Excel compared to the non-Excel based alternatives. So, What’s in the Model? Download the Model | Guide to Getting Started | Video Intro | Version Notes | Model Support With all the talk about limitations in Excel, you’d think I’m setting you up for just another back-of-the-envelope acquisition model. But fear not. This is like no model I’ve built before. I set out to build a model that does it all and right now, its pretty dang close! Acquisition, value-add/redevelopment, ground-up development, industrial, office, retail, apartment, student housing, seniors housing, various partnership structures, advanced underwriting modules, tabs that automatically hide/unhide depending on the selections you make, and the list goes on. Plus I’ll be adding additional modules as I find time (contribute your ideas in the model’s support forum). For example I recently added a robust multifamily module capable of modeling apartment, student housing, and seniors housing deals. In the future will added functionality for mixed-use valuations of any combination of retail, office, industrial, and multifamily uses that you could think of. I also plan to continue to add property-specific analysis sections for each property type using modules we’ve shared on A.CRE. So let’s have a look at what is included in the model. First, download the model and open it up alongside your browser. Then, read through the ‘Getting Started‘ sections below to get a basic understanding of how the model works. Finally watch the ‘Video Introduction‘ at the end of this post. I’ll be following this post up with model updates and additional training videos and posts. Friendly Request: If you find errors, have suggestions for how I can improve this model, or have a question about the model, please drop me a note in the All-in-One’s Support Forum and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible. Compatibility This version of the All-in-One is only compatible with Excel 2013, Excel 2016, and Excel 365 (see version compatibility).

        "content": "After posting the construction draw module that demonstrates how to calculate the true LTC of a development loan, I decided that since we have yet to publish a condo development model, to build upon that module to create one. This condominium model has a lot of really great functionality that will allow the user to get a solid understanding of the financial feasibility of their for-sale condominium project. The goal, as with all my models, was to make it powerful and comprehensive, while being as simple and user friendly as possible. The model includes the following seven, easy to navigate, tabs: 1) Summary 2) Inputs 3) Buyer Deposit Tracker 4) Budget 5) Cash Flow 6) Custom Cash Flow 7) Waterfall What’s In the Condo Development Model and How to Use It – A Brief Tab By Tab Overview <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-5297\" src=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/city-construction-series-1226400-639x853-495x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"535\" srcset=\"https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/city-construction-series-1226400-639x853-450x601.jpg 450w, https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/city-construction-series-1226400-639x853-224x300.jpg 224w, https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/city-construction-series-1226400-639x853-528x705.jpg 528w, https://www.adventuresincre.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/city-construction-series-1226400-639x853.jpg 639w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"/>1) The Summary Tab The summary tab contains all of the high-level relevant information for review and is designed to be easy to read, print, and save to pdf. It includes general info, a sources and uses summary, square footage and unit info, timing, dollar per sellable square foot analysis, and unlevered, levered, and partnership level returns. What the User Needs to Do in This Tab Input name, address, and project start date, lot size, project start date, and loan assumptions. 2) The Inputs Tab The Inputs tab contains workboxes for 1) timing of sales, 2) unit programming, 3) a stacking plan, and 4) pre-sales expense calculations for calculating tax payments and HOA fees before sellout. 3) Buyer Deposit Tracker Tab If you are using buyer deposits to help fund your development project, the Buyer Deposit tab allows you the option to track deposits from buyers and apply them to pay for development costs. 4) The Budget Tab The budget tab gives you the ability to create up to six main budget categories with 27 sub line items each. As you fill out the Budget Inputs section, the budget to the left will auto populate and auto-format and the main budget categories will shift up or down within the budget as line items are added. What’s great about this is that new items can be added to the budget under any category at any time and the user will not need to continuously reformat the page when they remember a budget line item they need to include. 5) The Cash Flow Tab (‘CF’ in the model) This tab contains the construction cash flow, unlevered cash flow, levered cash flow, and the equity and debt draw schedule. This tab is where you will also control the timing of the cash flow for each budget sub line item. What the User Needs To Do In This Tab On the left hand side between rows 7 and 186 you will see each budget category group has been grouped and hidden. Open each section to see the line items and set the timing and methodology for the cash flow. Please see both videos below for more thorough instructions and a demonstration of the functionality. 6) Custom Cash Flow (‘CustCF’) When you open the budget groups in the CF tab and select ‘Custom’ for a line item, come to this tab, open up the category group using the box with the ‘+’ sign in it on the left and look for the row highlighted in green. Fill in the custom cash flow to the right in the blue field. Guts of the model In many of my models posted on the site, the columns and rows that hold the mechanics of the model or are blank are hidden for aesthetic purposes. If you would like to see these areas to gain an understanding of how things are working in the background, you can simply unhide the cells to review. If you don’t know how to do this, you can click on the light gray arrow in the top left between the column A and row 1 labels or press Ctrl+A and go to Home>Cells>Format>Hide&Unhide>Unhide Rows. Repeat and Unhide Columns. 7) Waterfall Module Click the header above for the separate page that reviews this tab. Using the Condo Development Model – Video Tutorials Below, you’ll find a series of video tutorials that walk through the key functionalities of the Condo Development Model. Keep in mind that the model is regularly updated, so while the core features remain consistent, you may notice some visual differences or new features in the latest version. To stay fully informed, be sure to check out the version notes, where I detail every change and enhancement. Initial Summary of the C",
